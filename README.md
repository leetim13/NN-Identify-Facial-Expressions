# Neural Network: Human Facial Expressions Detection from Toronto Faces Dataset
Performed ReLU,softmax,and weight update with momentum and gradient descent during forward and back propagation.

Determined optimal hyper-parameters of learning rate, number of epochs,and batch-size, and momentum.

Implemented both KNN and a penalized logistic regression model for comparison.

Included all graphs for both training and validation sets.
